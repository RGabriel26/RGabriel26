🚀 Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 🌟</br>
Hey there! I'm Gabriel, a passionate electrical engineering student currently in my third year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Iasi. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you'll often find me exploring the realms of IT and programming, constantly eager to learn new things.


💻 Languages: I've delved into various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C.</br>
☕️ Java Journey: Explored the basics and collaborated on projects utilizing SpringBoot framework. Contributed to the development of a website [here](https://baschet.metropolabrasov.ro/)🏀 with the Generatia Tech team. Completed a Java programming course under their guidance.</br>
🐍 Python Projects: Familiarized myself with the fundamentals and crafted a Backgammon game using PyQt6 graphics library.</br>
